# Where to Find "Create Store" Button

## Step-by-Step Visual Guide

### Step 1: Go to your Vercel project
URL: https://vercel.com/ethan0905s-projects/h

### Step 2: Look for the "Storage" or "Stores" tab
In your project navigation, you should see tabs like:
- Overview
- Deployments
- Analytics
- Settings
- **Storage** or **Stores** ← Click this one

### Step 3: What you might see instead:

The button might be called any of these:
- ❓ "Create Database"
- ❓ "Connect Store"
- ❓ "Add Store"
- ❓ "Create Storage"
- ❓ "New Store"

### Step 4: If you don't see a "Storage" tab at all:

Then Blob storage might need to be enabled differently. Try this:

1. Go to: **https://vercel.com/ethan0905s-projects/h/settings**
2. Look for **"Storage"** or **"Integrations"** in the left sidebar
3. Click on it

## Alternative: Maybe Vercel changed the UI?

Let me describe what you should see:

When you go to https://vercel.com/ethan0905s-projects/h, the main navigation should have:
```
[Your Project Name "h"]
├── Overview
├── Deployments  
├── Analytics
├── Logs
├── Storage / Stores  ← This one!
└── Settings
```

## If you still can't find it:

Tell me what tabs you DO see when you go to:
https://vercel.com/ethan0905s-projects/h

I'll help you navigate based on what's actually there!

## Quick Check - Maybe it's called "Data"?

Some Vercel accounts show it as:
- **Data** tab
- **Storage** tab  
- **Stores** tab

All lead to the same place where you can create Blob storage.
